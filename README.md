# fpns_work
This repository includes the massive results of sensitivity analysis for the FPNS (Fusion Protypic Neutron Source) work and the basic input decks for the PHITS and FISPACK modeling. 
The sensitivity analysis contains beam numbers, beam height, beam offset angle, beam energy, gap thickness, lithium thickness and the reflector.
